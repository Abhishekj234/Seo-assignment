Improved Search Engine Optimization (SEO):

Title Tag: The meta title tag helps search engines understand the main topic of a webpage. It's displayed in search engine results, influencing click-through rates.
Meta Description: The meta description provides a concise summary of a webpage's content in search results, encouraging users to click on the link. Well-crafted meta descriptions can improve click-through rates and SEO.

Enhanced User Experience:
Viewport Meta Tag: The viewport meta tag is crucial for making web content mobile-responsive. It helps ensure that web pages display correctly on various devices and screen sizes, improving user experience.

Information for Social Media Sharing:
Open Graph Tags: These meta tags provide structured data to social media platforms like Facebook when a URL is shared. They control how the content appears when shared, including the title, image, and description.
Reduced Duplicate Content:

Canonical Tags: Canonical tags specify the preferred version of a webpage when duplicate or similar content exists. They help prevent duplicate content issues that can negatively impact SEO.

Favicon:
Favicon Tag: While not a traditional meta tag, the favicon tag specifies the icon (favicon) that appears in the browser tab when a user visits a webpage. It contributes to branding and recognition.
